# * Introduction: Probability, Cumulative Probability(Distribution) and Quantile ####
# functions
#  
# ** Probability function ####
#  
# - starts with the letter **d**: $p = P(X = x)$: p=d...(x,...)
#  
# ** Cumulative Probability(Distribution Function) ####
#  
# - starts with the letter **p**: $p = P(X \leq x)$:p=p...(x,...)
#  
# - note that Cumulative probability in R is with the alternative definition $P(X \leq
# t)$
#  
# - for our distribution function $F(t) = P(X<t)$: F(t)=p...(t - 1,...)
#  
# ** Quantile function ####
#  
# - starts with the letter **q**: $p \geq P(X \leq x)$: x=q...(p,...)
#  
# - searches for the smallest $x$ for which $P(X \leq x)$ is greater than $p$
#  


# * Binomial(Alternative): $X \sim Bi(n, π),X \sim A(π) = Bi(1, π)$ ####

# Alternative dist.)
