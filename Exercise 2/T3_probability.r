# From the alphabetical list of students enrolled in the exercise, the teacher selects

# sign, I will give each of you CZK 100. However, if there are at least two students
# among you who were born in the same sign, each of you will give me 100 CZK. ”Is it
# worthwhile for students to accept a bet? How likely are students to win?

# * Example 6. ####
#  
# The patient is suspected of having one of four mutually exclusive diseases - N1, N2,
# N3, N4 with a probability of occurrence of P(N1)=0.1; P(N2)=0.2; P(N3)=0.4; P(N4)=0.3.

# * Example 7. ####
#  
# Telegraphic characters consist of "dot" and "comma" signals. It is statistically found
# that 25% of "dot" messages and 20% of "comma" signals are distorted. It is also known
# that signals are used in a 3: 2 ratio. Determine the probability that the signal was
# received correctly if a "dot" signal was received.

# Bayes' theorem
P_O = c(0.6, 0.4)   # P(O.), P(O-)
P_PO = c(0.75, 0.2) # P(P.|O.), P(P.|O-)
bayes(P_B = P_O, P_AB = P_PO, k = 1) # k=1 because correctly=O.


# * Example 8. ####
#  
# 85% of green taxis and 15% of blue taxis run in one city. The witness of the traffic
# accident testified that the accident was caused by the driver of the blue taxi, who
# then left. Tests carried out under similar lighting conditions showed that the witness
# identified the color of the taxi well in 80% of cases and was wrong in 20% of cases.
#  
# - What is the probability that the culprit of the accident actually drove a blue taxi?
#  
# - Subsequently, another independent witness was found who also claims that the taxi
# was blue. What is the probability that the culprit of the accident actually drove a
# blue taxi now?
#  
# - Does the probability that the perpetrator of the accident actually drove a blue taxi
# affect whether the two witnesses mentioned above testified gradually or
# simultaneously?

# a) again Bayes' theorem
P_B = c(0.85, 0.15)  # P(Z), P(M)
P_SB = c(0.20, 0.80) # P(SM|Z), P(SM|M)
bayes(P_B = P_B, P_AB = P_SB, k = 2) # blue is second


# b) first option - second pass through Bayes
P_M = bayes(P_B = P_B, P_AB = P_SB, k = 2)
P_B = c(1 - P_M, P_M)  # P(Z), P(M)
P_SB = c(0.20, 0.80)   # P(S2M|Z), P(S2M|M)

# c) or answered at once
P_B = c(0.85, 0.15)      # P(Z), P(M)
P_SB = c(0.20^2, 0.80^2) # P(S1M & S2M|Z), P(S1M & S2M|M)

# * Example 9. ####
#  
# We need to find out the answer to a sensitive question. How to estimate what
# percentage of respondents will answer YES to the question and at the same time
# guarantee complete anonymity to all respondents? One of the solutions is the so-called
# double-anonymous survey:
# 
# We will let the respondents throw the coin A and the coin B. 
# - Those who got head on coin A will write the answer(YES/NO) to the sensitive question
# on teir card. 
# - Those who got tail on coin A will write YES = if coin B landed on head or NO = if
# coin B landed on tail. 
# 
# How do we determine the proportion of students who answered YES to a sensitive
# question?
# 
# Assume that respondents were asked if they were cheating on an exam. From the
# questionnaires, it was found that 120 respondents answered "YES" and 200 respondents
# answered "NO". What percentage of students cheated at the exam?
#  


# total probability theorem
# P(YES)=P(A_YES) * P(YES|A_YES) + P(A_NO) * P(B_YES|A_NO)
# equation 120/320=0.5 * x + 0.5 * 0.5
(120/320-0.5^2)/0.5

# * Bonus - Monty Hall Problem ####
#  
# You are winner of the TV competition. You are presented with three doors. Behind one
# is the crown prize and behind twe there is nothing. You have to pick one door. Then
# the moderator opens one of the two doors left (the ones you did not pick) and the
# doors without a prize (as the moderator knows where the prize is, he will always pick
# empty doors). 
# 
# Now the Question, will you stick with your original choice of the door, or you will
# switch to the other one still not opened?
