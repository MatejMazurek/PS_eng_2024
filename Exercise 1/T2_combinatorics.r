# * r-permutations ####
#  
# P(n, k) - r-permutations, the first argument will be the total number of entities, the
# second argument the size of the selection
#  


# the function is created by the fucntion command, it is an object whose name is given by a variable
# to which I will assign this object
r_permutation = function(n,k) # here I enter the number of parameters and their names
{ # the whole body of the function is enclosed in parentheses {...}
    numerator = factorial(n)  # the factorial in the original R exists so we will use it
    denominator = factorial(n-k)
    return(numerator/denominator)    # what the function returns is given in the return(...) statement
}

# P*(n, k) - r-permutations with repetition
#  


r_permutation_repetition = function(n,k)
{
  return(n^k)
}

# * Permutation ####
#  
# P(n)=P(n, n) - permutation
#  


permutation = function(n)
{
  return(r_permutation(n,n))
}

# P*(n1, n2, n3,...., nk) - permutation with repetition, input will be a vector with
# individual numbers of unique entities
#  


permutation_repetition = function(vec_n) # vec_n is the vector of values eg: vec_n=c(2,2,2,4,3)
{
    n = sum(vec_n) # we calculate how many values we have in total
    res_temp=factorial(n) # their factorial=value in the numerator
    # a simple loop starts with the for statement, then the iterator name follows in parentheses
    # and what list will be taken as iterable object
    for(count in vec_n) # count is an iterator and will gradually take values from the vector vec_n
    {
        # we gradually divide by the factorial of each number of unique entities
        res_temp=res_temp/factorial(count) 
    }
    return(res_temp)
}

# * Combination ####
#  
# C(n, k) - combination
#  


combinations = function(n,k)
{
  return(choose(n,k)) # the function for combination already exists in R and is called choose
}

# C*(n, k) - combination with repetition
#  


combinations_repetition = function(n,k)
{
  return(choose(n+k-1,k)) # we use a known formula
}

#  Exercise tasks ####

# * Example 1. ####
#  
# There are three types of locks available in the store. To open the first lock, it is
# necessary to press four of the ten buttons marked with numbers 0 to 9.(The order does
# not matter - the buttons remain pressed.) The second lock will open if we press six of
# the ten buttons. To open the third lock, it is necessary to set the correct
# combination on the four discs. Which of these locks best protects against thieves?

# * Example 2. ####
#  
# The store offers two types of briefcase locking. The first briefcase is locked with a
# six-digit cipher. The second case is locked with two locks that open at the same time.
# The cipher of each of them consists of three digits. Determine for each briefcase the
# probability of opening by a thief on the first attempt. Which type of lock is safer?

# * Example 3. ####

# * Example 4. ####
#  
# The student had to prepare answers to 40 questions for the exam. He could not answer
# the two questions the examiner asked him, so he said, “I'm unlucky! These are the only
# two questions I can't answer. ”How likely is he to tell the truth?
#  




# * Example 5. ####
#  
# A student passes a chemistry test if he underlines the only two aldehydes on the list
# of 40 chemical compounds. What is the probability that a student who underlines the
# compounds at random will pass the test?
#  




# * Example 6. ####
#  
# A group of 40 tourists returned from abroad, including 2 smugglers. At the border,
# customs officer called for a personal search of two passengers and it turned out that
# both were smugglers. The remaining tourists responded: "The customs officer was really
# lucky!", "Someone reported the smugglers!",.... How to deal with these statements? Is
# there a legitimate suspicion that someone reported the smugglers?
#  




# * Example 7. ####
#  
# From the urn with three balls, two red and one white, two balls will be selected at
# the same time. The student and the teacher place a bet. If both balls are of the same
# color, the student wins. If the balls have different colors, the teacher wins. Is the
# game fair? What are the probabilities of a teacher and a student winning?
#  


# the combn function produces combinations of the specified size - the first parameter is a vector of values, the second the size of the selection
combn(c('red','red','white'),2)

# * Example 9. ####

# You want to play "Man, don't be angry" (a board game requiring a dice), but all the
# dices are lost. How can a dice be replaced if you have playing cards(a deck of 32
# cards) and 4 different colored balls?

# * Example 11. ####
#

# standard equipment, they offer 3 items from the above-standard equipment free of
