#  Other selected continuous distributions ####
#  
# * $\chi^2$ - Chi-square distribution(Pearns distribution) ####
#  
# - Use: when estimating the standard deviation(using sampling)
#  
# - Has a single parameter - the number of degrees of freedom
#  
# - $\frac{S^2}{\sigma^2}(n-1) \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$
#  
# - $S$ is the sample standard deviation
#  


n =  5 # number of degrees of freedom
x = seq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 0.01) # x-axis
fx = dchisq(x = x, df = n) # chi-sq probability density. distribution

plot(x, fx, type='l')

Fx = pchisq(q = x, df = n) # distrib. f. of chi-sq. distribution

plot(x, Fx, type='l')

# * $t$ - Student's distribution ####
#  
# - Application: when estimating the mean without exact knowledge of variance(sampling
# only)
#  
# - $\frac{\bar X - \mu}{S}\sqrt{n} \sim t_{n-1} $
#  
# - $\bar X$ is the sample average
#  
# - $S$ is the sample standard deviation
#  
# - converges to a normalized normal distribution with increasing number of degrees of
# freedom
#  


n =  5 # number of degrees of freedom

Fnorm = pnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)  # norm values. normal birth
lines(x, Fnorm, col="red")      # to the last graph


# * $F$ - Fisher-Snedecor distribution ####
#  
# - Used to test ratio of variances
#  
# - $\frac{S_1^2/\sigma_1^2}{S_2^2/\sigma_2^2} \sim F_{n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1}$
#
