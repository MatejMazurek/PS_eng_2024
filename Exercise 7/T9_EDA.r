# Use CTRL + ENTER to run commands on a single line 

#  1. Packages - installation and loading ####
#  


# You only need to install packages once(if you don't already have them)
# install.packages("readxl")
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("openxlsx")
# install.packages("rstatix")

# Loading the package(must be repeated every time you restart R, it is advisable to have it 
# at the beginning of the script)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(openxlsx)
library(rstatix)
# contains notifications of overwritten functions or older versions of the package

#  2. Working directory - where we load and where we store data ####
#  
# - **Attention, the current open folder in Rstudio, or the location of the Rskcript is
# not automatically a working directory**
#  


# Working directory listing
getwd()

# Working directory setting -> in quotation marks, full path(relative or absolute)
setwd("./data")

getwd() # Where are we now?


setwd("./..") # back again


getwd() # for control


#  3. Load data file ####
#  


# * From CSV file ####
#  
# Basic functions - read.table, read.csv, read.csv2,... It depends mainly on the file
# format(.txt,.csv), the so-called separator of individual values, decimal point/dot
#  


# Load and save a data file in csv2 format from the working directory
data = read.csv2(file="aku.csv")

head(data)

data = read.csv2(file="aku.csv", sep=";", quote="", skip=0, header=TRUE)
head(data)

# Load and save a csv2 data file from the local disk to the data frame
data = read.csv2(file="./data/aku.csv")

# Load and save a csv2 data file from the Internet to the data frame
data = read.csv2(file="http://am-nas.vsb.cz/lit40/DATA/aku.csv")

# * From Excel(xlsx file) ####
#  
# Loading and saving a data file in xlsx format from the local disk to the data frame We
# use the function from the readxl package, which we expanded in the introduction
#  


data = read_excel("./data/aku.xlsx", 
                  sheet = "Data",           # worksheet specification in xlsx file
                  skip = 3)                 # lines to be skipped

head(data)

# * Remove unnecessary rows/columns and name rows/columns for easier data addressing ####
#  


# Indexing with negative indexes returns everything except the index value
# do not mix negative and positive indices!
data = data[,-1] # delete the first column with indexes
head(data)

# Rename columns - if necessary
colnames(data)=c("A5","B5","C5","D5","A100","B100","C100","D100") 
head(data)

# *** Note(which is good to read until the end....) ####
#  
# in Rstudio) it is possible to import using "Import Dataset" from the Environment
# window without having to write the code. In this case, however, there must be no
# special characters(hooks, commas) in the "path" to the file. Otherwise, an error will
# appear. The object imported this way will be in the new RSstudio as type "tibble".
# This is a more modern "data.frame" and in some features it can cause problems and
# throw errors! You can easily convert this object to type data.frame using
# **as.data.frame()**


#  4. Pre-processing data + Dplyr library ####
#  
# ** Overview of Dplyr library functions ####
#  
# - **%>%** is a so-called pipe operator, typical usage is "res=data %>% operation",
# where the result is a operation calibrated to data
#  
# - **select(...)** is one of the operations that we can insert into the "pipe" operator
# - it is used to select data
#     - select(1) - selects the first column
#     - select(A5) - selects the column named A5
#     - select(1,3,5) - selects columns 1,3,5
#  
# - **mutate(new_column=...)** is an operation that produces a new data column in the
# data frame using the specified calculation over the current columns
#     - data %>% mutate(C=A-B) produces a new column named "C" in the "data" data frame
# as the difference of the values in the existing columns "A" and "B"
#  
# - **filter(...)** filters values from the data that meet the specified requirements
#     - data %>% filter(manufacturer=="A"|manufacturer=="B") returns a data file that
# has only "A" or "B" values in the "manufacturer" column
#     - data %>% filter(manufacturer=="A", values>1000) if we write the requirements one
# after the other(separated by a comma) we understand it as logical **and**
#  
# - **summarize(...)** calculate the prescribed numerical characteristics within the
# specified columns(suitable for combination with group.by)
#     - data %>% summarize(prum=mean(kap5), median=median(kap5))
#  
# - **arrange(...)** ascending or descending row order
#     - data %>% arrange ascending
#     - data %>% arrange(desc) descending
#  
# - **group_by(...)** grouping of data according to unique values in the specified
# column
#     - data %>% group_by(manufacturer)
#  
# Very useful "cheat sheet" can be found here:
# https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf


# ** Column/row selections ####
#  


# Display of the first six lines
head(data)

# Display of the last six lines
tail(data)

# Display of line 10
data[10,]

# Display of the 3rd column - several ways
tmp = data[,3]
head(tmp)

# or(if we know the name of the variable written in the 3rd column)
data$C5

# or using the dplyr package select function, which selects the selected columns
tmp = data %>% select(C5)
head(tmp)

# Save the first and fifth columns of data frame
data_1_5 = data[,c(1,5)]
head(data_1_5)

# or using the dplyr function
data_1_5 = data %>% select(1,5)
head(data_1_5)

# or by name
data_1_5 = data %>% select(A5, "A100")
head(data_1_5)

# **Exclude data from the file.**


# Exclude the first and fifth columns from the data. data frames and data storage. framework attempt
temp_data = data[,-c(1,5)]
head(temp_data)

# or using dplyr
temp_data = data %>% select(-1, -5)
head(temp_data)

# or by name
temp_data = data %>% select(-A5,-A100)
head(temp_data)

# ** Basic conversion of a simple data matrix into a standard data format - stack(...) ####


data5 = data[,1:4] # from the data we select those columns that correspond to measurements after 5 cycles
colnames(data5) = c("A","B","C","D") # Rename columns
head(data5)

data5S = stack(data5)         # and transfer to st. data format
colnames(data5S) = c("kap5","manufacturer") # and edit the column names once more
head(data5S)

# We do the same for measurements performed after 100 cycles
data100 = data[,5:8] # we select from the data those columns that correspond to measurements after 100 cycles
colnames(data100) = c("A","B","C","D") # Rename columns
data100S = stack(data100)         # and transfer to st. data format
colnames(data100S) = c("kap100","manufacturer") # and edit the column names once more

# **If we want standard data type with both measurements, we should use reshape
# function:**


dataS=reshape(data=as.data.frame(data),
                  direction="long", # means we are going from data matrix (wide format)
                                    # into standard data format - long formant
                  varying=list(c("A5","B5","C5","D5"), # list of vectors with values for each
                               c("A100","B100","C100","D100")), # resulting column

                  timevar="manufacturer")
head(dataS)
# you can use na.omit(dataS) to remove NaN values from data frame

# **!!! Handle the na.omit function extremely carefully so that you do not inadvertently
# lose data !!!**
#  


# ** Defining new columns in a data frame ####


# Defining a new variable of the drop in the capacity
dataS$drop = dataS$cycles5 - dataS$cycles100

head(dataS)

# or using a function from the dplyr package
dataS = dataS %>% mutate(drop=cycles5-cycles100)

#  


dataS$cycles5

# May be useful - create separate variables

a5

# using dplyr with a data frame result
a5.df = dataS %>%
  filter(manufacturer=="A") %>%  # filters rows corresponding to manufacturer A
  select(cycles5)   # Selects only the values in column kap5,
head(a5.df)

# ** More detailed window for Dplyr library functions - work on data in standard data ####
# format
#  


# It is necessary to apply to data in st. data format !!! Pipe operator %>% - helps with
# chaining functions - in the new RSstudio shortcut key Ctrl + Shift + M
#  
# *** filter - applies a filter to the given column ####
#  


# filter - selects/filters rows based on given conditions
# Selection of products from the manufacturer
tmp = dataS %>% filter(manufacturer=="A")
head(tmp)

# Selection of products from manufacturer A or B
# separating conditions correspond to the logical "or"
tmp = dataS %>% filter(manufacturer=="A" | manufacturer=="B")  
head(tmp)

# Selection of all products with a decrease of 200 mAh and more from the manufacturer C
# comma separating conditions corresponds to logical "and at the same time"
tmp = dataS %>% filter(drop>=200, manufacturer=="C") 
head(tmp)

# *** mutate - produce a new column ####
#  


# mutate - adds a new variable or transforms an existing one
# Creating a new column drop_Ah, which indicates the capacity drop in Ah(original data in mAh, 1 Ah=1000 mAh)
tmp = dataS %>% mutate(drop_Ah=drop/1000)
head(tmp)
# Attention! if we do not save the result with the new column, it will only be printed and disappear

# *** summarize - generates summary characteristics of various variables ####
#  


# Calculation of the mean and median of all values of the variable cycles5
dataS %>% summarise(average=mean(cycles5),median=median(cycles5))

# **If the results contain NaNs, it means that the original data contained NaNs. There
# are two options, either drop NaNs from data, or set the function to ignore them.**
# **Be carefull with droping NaN values, you can loose data you want to keep. E.g. of
# you have data for capacity for 5 cycles, but not for 100, na.omit(...) will drop the
# whole line.**


tmp = na.omit(dataS)
tmp %>% summarise(average=mean(cycles5),median=median(cycles5))

dataS %>% summarise(average=mean(cycles5,na.rm = TRUE),median=median(cycles5,na.rm = TRUE))

# *** arrange - sorts rows according to the selected variable ####
#  


# Ascending and descending order of rows according to the decrease value
tmp = dataS %>% arrange(drop)
head(tmp)

tmp = dataS %>% arrange(desc(drop))
head(tmp)

# *** group_by - groups values into groups according to the selected variable ####
#  


# the table is "virtually" divided into groups for later processing, eg summarize
head(dataS %>% group_by(manufacturer))

# Ideal for calculating summary characteristics for each manufacturer separately, eg average
dataS %>%

# **Final note on dplyr(which is good to finish until the end...)**
#  
# **Some operations may throw a "tibble" object. This is a more modern data.frame,
# however it can cause problems and cause error messages in some functions! You can
# easily convert this "tibble" object to data.frame using as.data.frame().**

#  6. Exploratory analysis and visualization of a categorical variable ####
#  
# ** Notes on graphics in R ####
#  
# the basis are the so-called high-level functions, which create a graph(ie open the
# graphics window and draw according to the specified parameters) followed by the
# so-called low-level functions, which add something to the active graphics window, do
# not open new low-level functions - eg abline, points, lines, legend, title, axis...
# which add a line, points, legend... ie. before using the "low-level" function it is
# necessary to call the "high-level" function(eg plot, boxplot, hist, barplot, pie,...)
# Further graphic parameters can be found in the help or eg here
# http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/parameters.html or here

# - the standard deviation is rounded up to the prescribed number of digits(ceiling)

# - data file size = (10,30> -> 2 valid digits
# - data file size = (30,2000> -> 3 valid digits
# - position measures(averages, quantiles,...) are then rounded (classically) to the
