#  
# * Introduction: Probability Density, Distribution Function and Quantile Function ####
#  
# ** Probability density ####
#  
# - starts with the letter **d**: p=d...(x,...)
#  
# ** Distribution function ####
#  
# - starts with the letter **p**: $p = P(X < x)$:p=p...(x,...)
#  
# ** Quantile function ####
#  
# - starts with the letter **q**: find x for the given p: $p = F(x) \rightarrow x =
# F^{-1}(p)$: x=q...(p,...)
#  


# * Uniform distribution: $X \sim U(a, b)$ ####
#  
# - the random variable takes on only values greater than a and less than b
#  
# - all values have the same occurrence density ->the probability density is constant
# between a and b, elsewhere zero
#  


# Probability density f(x)
a = 2   # from where
b = 4   # up to
x = 3   
dunif(x, a, b)

# we plot the probability density
x = seq(from = 0, to = 6, by = 0.01)
f_x = dunif(x, a, b)

# * Exponential distribution: $X \sim Exp(\lambda)$ ####
#  
# - time to 1st event, time between events(only in the period of stable life - Poisson
# process)
#  
# - the parameter $\lambda$ is the same as in the Poisson distribution
#  
# - the mean value is: $E(X)=1 / \lambda$
#  


# Probability density f(x)

# * Weibull distribution: $X \sim W(\theta,\beta)$ ####
#  
# - time until the 1st event(faults)(suitable choice of β allows use in any period of
# fault intensity)
#  
# - extension of exponential distribution Exp(λ)=W(Θ=1/λ, β=1)

# * Normal distribution: $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ ####
#  
# - distribution modeling eg. measurement errors, sum/average behavior of many other
# random variables
#  
# - viz. Central limit theorem
#  
# - $\mu$ is the average distribution value: $E(X)=\mu$
